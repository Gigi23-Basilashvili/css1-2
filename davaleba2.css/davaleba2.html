                    The Magic of Glowing Creatures
                </h2>
                <p id="p2">
                    Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!
                </p>
                <p id="p3">
                    Here’s how it works:
                </p>
                <ol id="ol2">
                    <li>
                        A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.
                    </li>
                </ol>
